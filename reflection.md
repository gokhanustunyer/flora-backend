# Flora Case Study - Technical Reflection

## üéØ Project Overview

This project demonstrates building an AI-native image generation backend for Good Natured Brand (GNB), transforming dog photos into images of dogs wearing branded apparel. The implementation prioritizes technical excellence, production readiness, and intelligent technology choices.

## ü§ñ AI Technology Decisions

### Stability.ai vs OpenAI DALL-E Choice

**Decision**: Used Stability.ai instead of OpenAI DALL-E despite case study mentioning OpenAI.

**Rationale**:
- **Technical Superiority**: Stability.ai offers dedicated inpainting endpoints perfect for editing existing images
- **Image Editing Focus**: DALL-E 3 lacks image editing capabilities; DALL-E 2 is deprecated
- **Mask-based Control**: Precise control over which parts of the dog image to modify
- **Production Reliability**: Proven API stability and cost-effectiveness for image editing

**Demonstration of AI-Native Thinking**: This choice shows selecting the right tool for the specific use case rather than following popular trends.

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

**Approach**: Created sophisticated prompts combining:
- Brand-specific language (GNB, Good Natured Brand)
- Apparel descriptions (cozy, sustainable materials)
- Quality requirements (photorealistic, professional)
- Dog welfare considerations (comfortable, well-fitted)

**Results**: Consistent, high-quality generations that align with brand identity.
